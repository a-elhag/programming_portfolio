# Introduction

Income inequality refers to the disparity between the income distribution of a population. It is
typically measured using the Gini Coefficient. The coefficient takes values from 0 to 1, with one representing maximum
inequality in a society (in which one person has all the wealth) and with zero standing for
perfect equality (in which everyone has the exact same wealth). Today, most countries range from
0.25 to 0.7. There is no agreed upon ideal value of a Gini coefficient, mostly due to differing
political opinions in the countries and the fact that the ratio is only an approximation.
